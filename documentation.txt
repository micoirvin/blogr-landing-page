I think I've approached dropdowns incorrectly because I did not fully understand the workings of absolute and relative positioning. This time, I will try to apply my learnings in positioning to do the dropdowns.

Another concern is the bleeding of the image outside the box. I am thinking to use absolute positioning. Grid is also possible, but it might be an overkill?

Another concern is the positioning of the background image on the landing area?

I need to finish this in 2 days.

I am trying to find the measurements using Figma, doing some makeshift ruler.
    Landing:
        width: 1110px
        top margin : 60px
        header height: 48px
        bottom margin: 154px
        radius: 100px

    It took me some time to find a good arrow for dropdown. I can't believe that arrow does not exist naturally.

    Yesterday, I learned the issue of margin collapsing, and the solutions for that.

    Today, the main challenge was the background image.

    The centering was also kind of time-consuming. I should be able to remember this always.

    The arrows for dropdowns have always been provided. I just did not check it. Wow.

    Try grid with auto value on the column.

    Today, I think I wasted time thinking too much, not decided on what to do. However, I finally cleared my mind, and decided to use grids. Let's try and see. 

    I also dedicated some time doing some measurements to properly place the background image and to create some sort of fluid typography.

    My main tool is the function calc().

    Need to fix font size. Need to fix the positioning of the intro bg.

    The intro layout is already good. It is very responsive from small phone up to XL monitors.

    I need to organize my formulas.

    I used clamp and @media together. It makes the code better.

    TOO MUCH TIME USED.
